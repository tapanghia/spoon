						<div id="Regions Classifications">
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#EA463F"><b>Overview</span></p></b>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;">The region in the country MarkLabs is named Bizbay and it has a population of 50mn. It is a semi-urban market where few people are quite familiar with all the brands. It's a growing region with some characteristics of a stable market. Economists believe it is going to be the major growth driver for FMCG companies in the longer term. However, the products had very limited awareness till now in this region. So, your team not only has to improve the performance of your existing brands but also simultaneously pioneer successful launches in Bizbay. </p>

						<div id="Consumer Preferences">
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#EA463F"><b>Consumer Preferences</span></p></b>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;">Although MarkLabs is a big country with a very heterogeneous mix of people, market research indicates that on a broad level the consumers maybe divided into 5 major segments. Each segment has been identified based on their consumption behaviour for FMCG products. Gender has not been considered as the product is unisexual in nature and there is no significant difference between usage patters of male and female consumers.<br><br>

5 people from 5 distinct segment groups have been chosen. Let's read what do they have to share with us.</span></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Blue Bloods</span> - &quot; I am Raj, son of one of the biggest industrialists of the country. Very influential people occupy all our neighbouring bungalows and I have developed a very good social network with their children. I believe in the concept that everything good comes with a price. I prefer a very global style in whatever I eat, wear or use. I generally use only a few brands that I trust and the new brand has to be really good for me to change my existing brands. Whenever I require something, I just need to give the list to Ramu Kaka who gets it from the supermarkets. &quot;</i></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Raffles</span> - &quot; My name is Anita and I work as a senior manager in an MNC. My husband is a businessman and we live with our one and only son. As far as FMCG products are concerned we always go for good brands. To me, quality of the product is very important. We love to invite our friends at our house so it becomes far more important to buy good brands. Money, as you might have guessed by now, is not much of a problem. We typically stop at the supermarket in our locality on the way back from work to complete our purchase. &quot;</i></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Wannabees</span> - &quot; Hi, I am Nikhil. I am working in a top IT company for past 4 years.  I got married last year and my wife also works in an IT company. With our combined savings, we just got new flat in one of the posh localities of the city. We may not be able to purchase the Armani�s yet, but we believe branded products are better even if the price is slightly higher. Initially, we used to purchase all our goods from Mr. Lal�s General Store but lately we have started buying goods from QuickShop. &quot;</i></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Strugglers</span> - &quot; My name is Sunil. I belong to a middle class family. I work in a government company and earn just enough to support my family's basic needs. I have 2 children and a housewife. My parents also stay with me. Since my father has retired from public service, I have to support the whole family. I plan monthly expense budget and though I cannot provide very costly products to my family, I try to look for the best quality product within budget. We mostly buy products from Mr. Lal&apos;s General store as it is very close to our house. &quot;</i></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Deprived</span> - &quot; I am Prasad. I am a daily wage earner. My monthly income is Rs. 3000. I have a family of 8 and I am the sole earner in my family. I only purchase things, which are necessary for my family. Also since I do not have any savings, I prefer to buy things in small volumes so that I don�t have to incur big expenses. I don�t remember the names of the brand but I do recognize the packaging of the products. Mostly either my wife or me do the household purchase at the Girdhari&apos;s kirana store at the corner of the lane. &quot;</i>/</p>

						<div id="Channel Members Preferences">
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#EA463F"><b>Channel Members Preferences</b></span></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";>The distribution channels in MarkLabs refers to the outlets where the consumers can directly go and purchase goods. There are three distribution channels available in MarkLabs. Let's read what do the owners of these distinct channels have to share.</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Standalone Supermarkets</i></span> - &quot; I am Kamal, Owner of QuickShop, one of the biggest retail chains in this region. Our motto is to provide the products at the least price to our customers. We are a one-stop shop for all the needs of a family.  We cater to wide range of clientele from bottom to the top of the pyramid so we need to store all kinds of products. Our margins are less but we more than make up for it by the volumes. We are planning to expand to the nearby states in the next two years and become a national player in the next 5 years. One major benefit we see from scaling up is the increased bargaining power we will get with the manufacturers.  We frequently offer discount schemes to attract customers. &quot;</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>General Merchants</i></span> - &quot; I am Ratan Lal and I own a general store. I store all the products of general use from groceries to cosmetics. Earlier the business used to be good but nowadays, some of my old customers have started buying from the newly opened QuickShop. To regain our business, we have recently started providing home delivery to our clients for their convenience. Many of our customers are middle class people. Therefore, we are a little careful while storing costly items.  &quot;</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Kirana Stores</i></span> - &quot; My name is Girdhari. I run a very small shop besides the street of this housing colony. I have been running this shop for last 30 years. I know almost all the people in this locality. Some people come and demand certain established brands, but to majority of them I convince and sell local brands that provide me high margins. &quot;</p>
